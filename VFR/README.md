# VFR phraseology

**_Example with Sofia Airport (ICAO: LBSF)_**

_We will take a flight with callsign **LZBKGE**_.

The order normally is the following:

1. Departure clearance
2. Startup (and/or pushback)
3. Taxiing
4. Take-off

_Note: The 1. (departure clearance) could be given at the holding point (after 3. Taxiing)_

_Note: For **VFR** the **2. (Startup and pushback)** and **3. (Taxiing)** are generally **same as an IFR flight**_.

[*] - Left/Right hand traffic pattern, dependend on runway in use and airport procedures (for this example in LBSF, Right - 27 and Left - 09).

## 1. Traffic pattern

### 1. Departure clearance

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE with information B on board, requesting VFR flight for traffic circuits.

**ATC**: LZBKGE, cleared for [*] traffic pattern, runway [active_runway], not above altitude [pattern_altitude] feet, squawk [assigned_squawk]

**Pilot:** Cleared for [*] traffic pattern, runway [active_runway], not above altitude [pattern_altitude], squawk [assigned_squawk], LZBKGE.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, readback is correct.

or

**ATC:** LZBKGE, negative, [correct_callback].


### 2. Startup

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE requesting startup.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, QNH [current_pressure], startup is approved.

_Note: You could always delay the startup for any reason, as you would do for an IFR flight. The example only covers the basics_.

**Pilot:** QNH [current_pressure], startup approved, LZBKGE.

### 3. Taxiing

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE request taxi.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, taxi via [taxi_instructions].

**Pilot:** Taxiing via [taxi_instructions], LZBKGE.

...

*At Holding point.*

Note: Step 1. could be made here, just before take-off.

### 4. Take-off

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE is ready for departure.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, winds [current_winds], runway [active_runway], cleared for take-off. When airbourne remain of Tower frequency and report on downwind.

**Pilot:** Cleared for take-off, runway [active_runway], when airbourne will remain on Tower frequency and will report on downwind, LZBKGE.

...

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE is currently on downwind.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, report intentions.

### In the air (traffic pattern)

There could be generally 3 options that could be reported as intentions:

1. Touch-and-Go
2. Lowpass

...

3. Full-stop landing

The 1. and 2. are non-stop intentions, 3. is Ð° full stop intention.

### 1. Touch-and-Go

_After report on downwind, ATC asks for intentions_

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, we request Touch-and-Go, LZBKGE.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, roger. Report on base turning final.

...

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE on base, turning final, runway [active_runway].

**ATC:** LZBKGE, wind [current_winds], runway [active_runway], cleared for Touch-and-Go, after Touch-and-Go, report on downwind.

**Pilot:** Cleared for Touch-and-Go, runway [active_runway], after Touch-and-Go will report on downwind, LZBKGE.

...

The pattern continues with reporting intentions on downwind and doing the same thing.

### 2. Lowpass

_After report on downwind, ATC asks for intentions_

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, we request Lowpass, LZBKGE.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, roger. Report on base turning final.

...

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE on base, turning final, runway [active_runway].

**ATC:** LZBKGE, wind [current_winds], runway [active_runway], cleared for Lowpass, after Lowpass, report on downwind.

**Pilot:** Cleared for Lowpass, runway [active_runway], after Lowpass will report on downwind, LZBKGE.

...

The pattern continues with reporting intentions on downwind and doing the same thing.

### 1. Full-stop landing

_After report on downwind, ATC asks for intentions_

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, we request full-stop landing, LZBKGE.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, roger. Report on base turning final.

...

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE on base, turning final, runway [active_runway].

**ATC:** LZBKGE, wind [current_winds], runway [active_runway], cleared to land.

**Pilot:** Cleared to land, runway [active_runway], LZBKGE.

...

After landing, taxi instructions should be given to the aircraft to a designated stand.

[**] - **Left/Right** turnout, dependend on runway in use and airport procedures.

## 2. Flight for another airport

### 1. Departure clearance

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE with information [ATIS_information] on board, requesting VFR flight to [destination].

**ATC**: LZBKGE, cleared VFR to [destination], after departure runway [active_runway], turn [**] to [initial VFR point] then as filed, not above altitude [max_altitude_within_airport_cta], squawk [assigned_squawk].

**Pilot:** Cleared VFR to [destination], after depature runway [active_runway], turn [**] to [initial_vfr_point] then as filed, not above altitude [max_altitude_within_airport_cta], squawk [assigned_squawk], LZBKGE.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, readback is correct.

### 2. Startup

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE requesting startup.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, QNH [current_pressure], startup is approved.

_Note: You could always delay the startup for any reason, as you would do for an IFR flight. The example shows the basics_.

**Pilot:** QNH [current_pressure], startup approved, LZBKGE.

### 3. Taxiing

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE request taxi.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, taxi via [taxi_instructions].

**Pilot:** Taxiing via [taxi_instructions], LZBKGE.

...

Step 1. could be made here, just before take-off.

### 4. Take-off

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE is ready for departure.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, winds [current_winds], runway [active_runway], cleared for take-off. When airbourne remain on Tower frequency and report passing [initial_vfr_point].

**Pilot:** Cleared for take-off, runway [active_runway], when airbourne will remain on Tower frequency and will report passing [initial_vfr_point], LZBKGE.

...

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE report passing [initial_vfr_point].

**ATC:** LZBKGE, roger, report passing [waypoint].

...


**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE report passing [waypoint].

**ATC:** LZBKGE, roger, you are leaving my zone, continue as filed, monitor UNICOM on 122.800.

_Note: If aircraft will be above certain altitude after leaving CTA instead on UNICOM, the aircraft should be transferred either to Approach or to Control. Please, coordinate this with the following position above you._

## 3. Leaving Sofia Control Zone

It is basically the same as **2. Flight for another airport**, except for the clearance details.

### 1. Departure clearance

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE with information [ATIS_information] on board, requesting leaving the Sofia control zone, via [cta_exit_waypoint].

_Note: [cta_exit_waypoint] - for example ADBIL to the north-east, or XUDLA to the south-east and so on)_

**ATC**: LZBKGE, cleared exit the Sofia control zone via [airway], after departure runway [active_runway], turn [**] to [initial VFR point] then as filed, not above altitude [max_altitude_within_airport_cta], squawk [assigned_squawk].

_Note:_ The [airways] in Sofia could be eg. V430, V428 V426 and such (look at the VFR charts).

**Pilot:** Cleared to exit the Sofia control zone via [airway], after depature runway [active_runway], turn [**] to [initial_vfr_point] then as filed, not above altitude [max_altitude_within_airport_cta], squawk [assigned_squawk], LZBKGE.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, readback is correct.

### 2. Startup

_Same as the previous ones._

### 3. Taxiing

_Same as the previous ones._

### 4. Take-off

_Same as the take-off for **2. Flight for another airport**_

## 4. Entering Sofia Control Zone

_Note: Before entering the Sofia Control Zone, the aircraft must contact you and request a permission to enter._

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, LZBKGE request entering the Sofia control zone, inbound [waypoint] for [intentions].

_Note: [intentions] - could be for example full-stop landing in the airport or such._

**ATC:** LZBKGE, Sofia Tower, cleared to enter Sofia control zone via [airway], report passing [waypoint].

_Note:_ The [airways] in Sofia could be eg. V430, V428 V426 and such (look at the VFR charts). Also aircraft must report before passing the last waypoint to be given permission to continue towards runway._

**Pilot:** Cleared to enter Sofia control zone via [airway], will report passing [waypoint], LZBKGE.

...

**Pilot:** Sofia Tower, report passing [waypoint], LZBKGE.

_Note: You could request a holding pattern over waypoint in order for other traffic to be cleared, or give landing clearance directly_.

**ATC:** LZBKGE, winds [winds], runway [active_runway] cleared to land.
